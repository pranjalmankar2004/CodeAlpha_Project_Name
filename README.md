**Code Alpha Internship Projects**

This repository contains projects completed during my data science internship at Code Alpha. The tasks include:

Titanic Classification: Implemented a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression: Built a linear regression model to predict numerical outcomes based on feature data.
A/B Testing Analysis: Conducted an A/B testing analysis to determine the statistical significance of changes in a product or service.
Explore the code and insights gained from these real-world data science tasks!
